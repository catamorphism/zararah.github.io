<p>I've been coming across articles highlighting 2013's greatest feminist moments - this <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/76145/28-most-iconic-feminist-moments-of-2013">28 Most Iconic Feminist moments of 2013</a> for example, or the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/11/best-moments-for-women-2013_n_4400780.html">25 best moments for women in 2013</a> - and while they have some brilliant moments included, I couldn't help but notice that they're very US-centric [1]. Surely the majority of 2013 feminist wins didn't happen in the US alone? </p>
<p>Well, no - feminism is alive and kicking in the rest of the world too, and  here's ten examples highlighting just how. </p>
<h2 class="title">A self-declared feminist and women's rights activist became Prime Minister of Senegal</h2>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xeI_wsMZpfY" width="420"></iframe></p>
<p>In September, <a href="http://www.france24.com/fr/20130903-aminata-toure-madame-anti-corruption-senegal-desormais-premier-ministre/">Aminata Touré became Prime Minister of Senegal</a>. True to her unique style, she even<a href="http://senego.net/2013/09/01/aminata-toure-nommee-premier-ministre-senegal-macky-sall_113263.html"> announced her new appointment herself.</a> Former Justice Minister, she's known for her strong anti-corruption stance, and <a href="http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20130901-senegal-aminata-toure-nommee-premier-ministre-senegal">has had an impressive career as a human rights activist.</a> And let's not forget; Malawi and Liberia also have female heads of state - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Banda">Joyce Banda</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Johnson_Sirleaf">Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,</a> respectively. </p>

<h2 class="title">Chimamanda Ngoza Adichie's TedX Talk “We should all be feminists”;</h2>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/hg3umXU_qWc" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Being sampled in Beyoncé's track “Flawless”; probably did wonders for Adichie's popularity among a whole new audience - it's well deserved, though. A related feminist win - her latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Americanah-Chimamanda-Ngozi-Adichie/dp/0307271080%20">Americanah</a>, came out earlier this year. Highly, highly recommended.</p>
<h2 class="title">In Rwanda, women won 64% of seats in Parliament.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/speakersconference2010/4799142709/" title="Rose Mukantabana: Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Rwanda by Third World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, on Flickr"><img alt="Rose Mukantabana: Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Rwanda" height="426" src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4080/4799142709_028561ac6c_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Rwanda beat their own record of percentage of women in parliament – jumping from 56.3%  <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/index.php?i=15485&amp;a=70547">to a massive 64 per cent  of women</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Women now occupy 51 out of the 80 seats in the Lower House, thus retaining the title of being <a href="http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm%E2%80%93">the only country in the world with a female dominated parliament</a>- a title they first earned in 2008, when women held 56% of seats. There's a quota in place to ensure female representation, but it's only for 30% of seats. <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/meetings/2004/CSW48Panel/csw48panel-kantengwa.pdf">More on Rwanda's gender-friendly policies here</a></p>

<h2 class="title">Mayam Mahmoud, Egypt's first hijab-wearing rapper</h2>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/L1MrA3435Ik" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Aged 18, Mayam Mahmoud got through to the semi finals of Arabs got talent; she encouraged people to look past her veil, and listen to what she's rapping about. </p>
<h2 class="title">The release of the first feature film directed by a Saudi Arabian woman *</h2>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3koigluYOH0" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Written and directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour, Wadjda (Arabic: وجدة,) was filmed in the streets of Riyadh, meaning that the director had to work from the back of a van to avoid publicly mixing with men working on her crew. The film- the first feature film to be shot entirely in Saudi Arabia, was also the country's first official submission to the Oscars for the Best Foreign Language Film. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jul/16/wadjda-saudi-arabia-female-director-video">Listen to Haifaa Al-Mansour talk about the challenges she faced, and changes happening in Saudi Arabia here. </a></p>

<h2 class="title">Women were finally invited to take part in Colombian government negotiations with FARC</h2>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lXt8DkdlR9Y" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p><a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/for-colombia/women-war-peace-colombian-women-demand-truth-justice/12761%20">After huge efforts by Colombian women's groups </a>working to highlight the key role of women in peacebuilding, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos finally announced that women would be invited to join the negotiation team. María Paulina Riveros y Nigeria Rentería Lozano, both lawyers, <a href="http://www.elcolombiano.com/BancoConocimiento/P/proceso_de_paz_maria_paulina_riveros_y_nigeria_renteria_nuevas_negociadoras_en_la_habana/proceso_de_paz_maria_paulina_riveros_y_nigeria_renteria_nuevas_negociadoras_en_la_habana.asp">joined the previously all-male team at the end of November 2013</a>.</p>

<h2 class="title">A record number of women presidents in Latin America; 4 women heads of state</h2>

<p>Despite being a continent known for “machismo”, there are now women leading Argentina (<span>Cristina Fernández de Kirchner)</span>, Brazil (<span>Dilma Rousseff)</span>, Costa Rica (<span>Laura Chinchilla)</span>, and most recently Chile, following <a href="http://www.lanacion.cl/minuto-a-minuto-con-resultados-parciales-bachelet-aventaja-a-matthei/noticias/2013-12-15/173623.html">Michelle Bachelet's overwhelming win </a>with 62% of the vote earlier this month. No implied endorsement of any of their policies, though! </p>
<h2 class="title">Satirical video “No Woman No Drive”; went viral *</h2>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aZMbTFNp4wI" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>This video, mocking Saudi Arabia's ban on letting women drive, hit 10 million views earlier in the year. Here's hoping some of the princes saw it too. </p>
<h2 class="title">Women's empowerment recognised as a major reason behind Bangladesh's health successes</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ricephotos/9005049048/" title="Women in Bangladesh - IRRC photo by IRRI Images, on Flickr"><img alt="Women in Bangladesh - IRRC photo" height="480" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/9005049048_cf36db3a8e_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Medical journal The Lancet released <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/series/bangladesh">a series of papers looking at healthcare in Bangladesh</a>, saying</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span>Improvements in the survival of infants and children under 5 years of age, life expectancy, immunisation coverage, and tuberculosis control in Bangladesh are part of a remarkable success story for health [in Bangladesh].</span></p>
<p><span>...<span>Perhaps the most powerful strategy for health was the country's distinct acknowledgment and support of women to national development.”;</span></span></p>

<h2 class="title">Yemen's human rights minister called for a ban on child marriage </h2>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/irinphotos/4194872350/" title="Yemen IDPs 4 by IRIN Photos, on Flickr"><img alt="Yemen IDPs 4" height="427" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2790/4194872350_d9a8bf3165_z.jpg" width="640"/></a></p>

<p>In September, Huriya Mashhoor, the Minister for Human Rights in Yemen, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/09/201391413182157493.html">called for the revival of </a><a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/09/201391413182157493.html">a bill </a>which would set the legal minimum age for marriage to 18 years old. Her decision came after international condemnation following reports that an<a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/09/201391413182157493.html"> 8 year old died of internal bleeding on the night she married a 40 year old man.</a> </p>
<p>Though no further progress has been reported, in November this year, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24870526">Yemeni police stopped the wedding of a nine year old girl</a>; it was reportedly the <span>first such intervention to stop a child marriage in Yemen.</span></p>

<p><a id="footnote" name="footnote"></a>1 Suggestion: consider adding “from the US”; on to the end of both of those headlines, to avoid over-reduction of the global feminist movement. </p>
<p>* Not strictly 'majority world' countries - but ones where improvements in women's rights are thoroughly needed, so I've included them here. </p>
<p><em>Wherever possible, I've tried to use local media sources in the links here- if there are any that could be replaced, let me know! I know I've missed lots out lots of other great moments, too - any to add, ping me @zararah or drop me a line zararah[at]gmail.com </em></p>
