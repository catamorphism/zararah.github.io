<p>As I've been learning more about coding, a number of unusual terms and phrases have come up, and I've been having fun finding out more and discovering their etymology. I'm documenting these findings in <a href="https://github.com/zararah/learnings/blob/master/funny-coding-words.md" target="_blank">this glossary I've started</a>, and I've set it up on Github to make it as easy as possible for others to contribute. </p>
<p>It's in very early stages yet - I'd like to add examples of each term, and make sure it's explained in a way that non-coders can understand, too. I've tried to distill some technical explanations down into easy-to-understand definitions, so if I've made any mistakes in my understanding, please let me know! </p>
<p>If you have any other terms to add, corrections to make or definitions to expand upon, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/zararah/learnings/blob/master/funny-coding-words.md" target="_blank">submit a pull request directly</a>! </p>
