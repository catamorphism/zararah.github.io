<p>The worst kind of creep is he who thinks of himself as a Good Man.</p>
<p>He who has dedicated his life to making the world a better place, but not in a self-righteous way; merely in a pragmatic, no-regrets, taking moral responsibility kind of way.</p>
<p>He who is highly renowned within his field, who has done brilliant work, and had some innovative and great ideas, which have had a positive effect on the lives of many.</p>
<p>He who has built up a professional and personal reputation as being tolerant and respectful of others.</p>
<p>He who has long-established relationships with other key members of the community; supportive, positive relationships, where he's proven his loyalty on numerous occasions, and always been there for them.</p>
<p>He who comes across, upon first, second or third meetings, as a fascinating man, with lots of valuable experience and a willingness to share this with others, for mutual benefit.</p>
<p>He who listens and sympathises with others relating tales of discrimination, harassment, or creepy people.</p>
<p>He who, if cases of his creepy tendencies were to come out, would plead misunderstanding, and publicly apologise profusely, all while remaining convinced that his actions were misinterpreted through zero fault of his own.</p>
<p>He who <strong>genuinely </strong>can't fathom the idea of himself being a creep.</p>
<p>He who does it again, and again, and again.</p>
