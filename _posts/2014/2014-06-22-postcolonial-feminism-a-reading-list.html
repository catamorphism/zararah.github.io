<p>I asked recently on Twitter if anyone had recommendations for reading material on the topic of postcolonial feminism; admittedly, a very general question, but sometimes it can be difficult to know where to start when you're new to a certain topic.</p>
<p>I got some great suggestions of reading material, and wanted to record them here for posterity, and in case they're useful to other people looking to learn more about the topic. I'm working my way through them now...</p>
<p>(Thank you to <a href="https://chitrasudhanagarajan.wordpress.com/">Chitra Nagarajan</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mayameme">Maya Ganesh</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/xeenarh">Xeenarh</a> for your suggestions! Any others – <a href="http://twitter.com/zararah">let me know</a>.)</p>
