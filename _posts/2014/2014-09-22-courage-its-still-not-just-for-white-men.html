<p>I woke up this morning to see <a href="http://jilliancyork.com/2014/09/21/courage/">this post</a> by Jillian York, “Courage – it&#8217;s not just for white men”. Suffice to say, I wholeheartedly agree with it, especially the idea of remixing that wholly reductive image released by Pirate Parties International.</p>

<p>As Jillian mentions, there are a whole host of women and people of colour that didn&#8217;t appear on the remixed version she produced; so, here&#8217;s another, with the people who came to mind for me.</p>

<p><em>Clockwise from top left: <a href="http://freebassel.org/">Bassel Khartabil</a>), Salwa Bughaighis, who was assassinated just a couple of months ago- (<a href="http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/30/sowfa-tabqa-huna-she-shall-remain-here/">this blog post</a> written by her nieces is a good place to start learning about her), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigoberta_Mench%C3%BA">Rigoberta Menchú</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_al-Khawaja">Maryam al-Khawaja</a>, <a href="http://threatened.globalvoicesonline.org/blogger/adilur-rahman-khan">Adilur Rahman Khan</a>, Sanaa Seif (<a href="http://www.fidh.org/en/north-africa-middle-east/egypt/15973-joint-statement-egypt-woman-human-rights-defender-sanaa-seif-starts-a">news here</a> and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/egypt-release-women-s-rights-defender-protesters-arrested-challenging-draconian-protest-law-20-0">here</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadija_Ismayilova">Khadija Ismayilova</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoani_S%C3%A1nchez">Yoani Sanchez</a>.</em></p>

<p>I wonder though, how many people could come up with a list of 9 brave women, or people of colour, just like that? A couple of years ago, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have been able to.</p>

<p>Recently though, I&#8217;ve been trying to be a lot more aware of the voices I&#8217;m listening to, whether that be through books I&#8217;m reading (hence my only reading books by women this year) – people I&#8217;m following on Twitter (trying to follow people who are in areas of the world I know little about, or those with different social situations to me) – or the media I consume (trying to find media sources from inside the country I&#8217;m reading about, rather than sticking to international sources.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in Jillian&#8217;s post, the problem is self-perpetuating, and, I would suggest, all too easy to ignore, until it comes to the issue of having to find, for example, a “diverse” conference line up. In these cases, the excuse of “but I didn&#8217;t know anyone else” comes up far too often; of course you didn&#8217;t, because you stuck to the mainstream and made no effort to find voices who are marginalised and ignored by this system. It&#8217;s no surprise.</p>

<p>Becoming aware of who you&#8217;re listening to and where your information comes from is the first step; once you start looking, it&#8217;s really not so hard to find people with different world views out there to listen to and learn from.</p>

<hr><p>Are there other people who come to mind for you, who should be on one of these? With apologies to my graphic designer friends, I did this version using Preview on Mac, as follows:</p>

<ul><li><p>find an image of someone</p></li>
<li><p>select a square section of it</p></li>
<li><p>copy and paste into the original ( I would recommend using <a href="http://jilliancyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/couragehasmanyfaces_2.png">this high res original</a>, not my one!</p></li>
</ul><p>The most time consuming aspect for me was finding public domain images - I wanted to include Meriem Ibrahim, for example, but couldn&#8217;t find an image of her.</p>

<p>Why not make your own?</p>
