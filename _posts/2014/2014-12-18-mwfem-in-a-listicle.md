All year, I've been keeping a custom Twitter timeline of cool acts of feminism that are happening in the 'majority world' - ie. low-income countries. I wrote about why I've been doing that [here](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/04/13/getting-new-perspectives-online-listening-to-the/) earlier in the year.

<a class="twitter-timeline" href="/zararah/timelines/420423544334336000" data-widget-id="545688349869363200">Majority World feminism</a>
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script>

One reason I hadn't thought about so clearly though, was that I wanted to make it really easy for people to learn about all these awesome women. As you can probably tell, a custom Twitter timeline isn't the most user-friendly of interfaces (not to mention, it's very hard to come across without already knowing the URL.)

So, this week, after being inspired by this great list of [18 badass women](http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/badass-women-alert) I picked out my own favourites from the timeline, and made them into a Buzzfeed community listicle: [24 fierce acts of feminism you probably didn't hear about in 2014.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/zararah/24-fierce-acts-of-feminism-you-probably-didnt-hea-16n5q) 

Hopefully this makes it easier for people to read through and find!
