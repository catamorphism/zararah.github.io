## Feminism 

OK, clearly the 'feminism' list is going to be a long one. I tried to narrow this down as much as I could!

<div class="pull-right"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/empowerment-illustration.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Women's empowerment illustration"></div>

* [Illustrations on women's empowerment](http://mic.com/articles/92651/18-empowering-illustrations-to-remind-everyone-who-s-really-in-charge-of-women-s-bodies), by Brazilian graphic designer [Carol Rossetti](https://www.facebook.com/carolrossettidesign/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums). (right)
* [Call yourself an "intersectional" feminist?](http://www.feministtimes.com/call-yourself-an-intersectional-feminist/) by [Reni Eddo-Lodge](http://renieddolodge.co.uk/).
* On the [exclusion of Islamic feminism within "western" feminism](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10702454/Islam-and-feminism-British-Muslim-women-dont-need-the-Wests-version-of-feminism-OK.html), by [Shelina Zahra Janmohamed](https://twitter.com/loveinheadscarf).
* [Foreign Policy Interrupted's newsletter](http://us3.campaign-archive1.com/home/?u=aa33697c972ec5a710463b61d&id=f1530ad4b3) landing in my inbox every Friday with a round up of women writing on foreign policy is a highlight of my week. Really great way to increase visibility working in this field.
* Lego's new [set of female scientist/researcher figures](http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Research-Institute-21110) - which has, unsurprisingly, been "overwhelmingly popular" and out of stock since it went on sale.
* [How not to study gender in the Middle East](http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/4775/how-not-to-study-gender-in-the-middle-east) - long, but some great points. By [Maya Mikdashi](https://twitter.com/mayamikdashi)
* From 2011, but I came across it this year and love it: on [Why we need to dismantle the myth of 'Western' feminism](https://chitrasudhanagarajan.wordpress.com/2011/03/05/why-we-need-to-dismantle-the-myth-of-western-feminism/) by [Chitra Nagarajan](https://twitter.com/chitranagarajan).


* Men writing about feminism is always a delicate balancing act- in my opinion, Robert Webb [does it pretty well here](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/08/robert-webb-roll-roll-see-man-talking-about-feminism-what-could-possibly-go-wrong).
* ["Who killed Adulthood"](http://inthesetimes.com/article/17194/who_killed_adulthood) by [Sady Doyle](https://twitter.com/sadydoyle)
* Okay, it's an advert - but it's clever, and poignant.

* [What harassment is like for women](http://www.tickld.com/x/next-time-someone-says-women-arent-victims-of-harassment-show-them), in cartoon form. Really good.
* I haven't watched it yet, but I'm so happy that an Iranian feminist vampire film was released this year - [A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/10/28/a_girl_walks_home_alone_at_night_watch_the_trailer_for_an_iranian_vampire.html).
* [Raja Ravi Varma’s Women Rejecting Marriage Proposals](http://ravivarmaswomen.tumblr.com/), with a big hat tip to the original [Women Rejecting Marriage Proposals In Western Art History](http://the-toast.net/2014/11/06/women-rejecting-marriage-proposals-western-art-history/).
* [Awkward moments for feminists](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ailbhemalone/awkward-moments-for-feminists), beautifully illustrated by [Naoise Dolan](http://not-a-bene.tumblr.com/).
* [18 Badass Women You Probably Didn’t Hear About In 2014](http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/badass-women-alert#.ptx2MMdYle) - wonderful examples of feminism from all around the world. I added my own to [another Buzzfeed post](http://www.buzzfeed.com/zararah/24-fierce-acts-of-feminism-you-probably-didnt-hea-16n5q), too.

## Diversity + inclusivity 

Lots of this could fit in 'feminism' too.

* [Open Dyslexic](http://opendyslexic.org/), an open source font reated to increase readability for readers with dyslexia.
* On the [potential consequences of new Hacker News comment policy](http://transientneha.blogspot.de/2014/03/unintended-consequences.html): men needing to endorse women's comments, by [Neha Narula](http://transientneha.blogspot.de/p/about.html).

By [Karen Walrond](http://www.chookooloonks.com/about/).

<div class="pull-right"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/disney-princesses.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Disney Princesses"></div>

* [Disney princesses, re-imagined as different ethnicities](http://www.boredpanda.com/disney-princess-race-reimagined-lettherebedoodles/). I alternated between dressing up as Pocahontas and Jasmine when was younger - these would've given me so many more options...!

* [A playable post on the shape of society](http://ncase.me/polygons/) -a fun interactive explanation of diversity in society.

* A new New York Times video series, [Off Colour](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/arts/off-color-hari-kondabolu-video-series-.html?_r=0), highlighting "artists of color who use humor to make smart social statements about ways that race plays out in America today."
* I've referred to this a lot this year - [how to tell a white person they are being racist](http://www.newleftproject.org/index.php/site/article_comments/how_to_tell_a_white_person_they_are_being_racist), by [Alice Bell](https://twitter.com/alicebell).

## Bangladesh

Not all of these were produced this year, but they're the most interesting things I came across about Bangladesh online. 

* Powerful photo project [showing servants next to housewives in Dhaka](http://www.vocativ.com/culture/photos/masters-servants-south-asia-9-questions-jannatul-mawa/), to highlight the "distance between two people who often live under the same roof.". By [Jannatul Mawa](http://mawaspace.wordpress.com/profile/about-me/).
* This year, Bangladesh's first magazine aimed at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues was launched - [Roopbaan](http://www.dhakatribune.com/arts-amp-culture/2014/jan/20/first-ever-lgbt-magazine-launched).
* The [utterly ludicrous borders of Bangladesh](http://www.courrierinternational.com/files/2014/hebdos/1253/1253-infographie.jpg) - including the world's only third order enclave- Dahala Khagrabari is a piece of India within Bangladesh, within India, within Bangladesh. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/bangladesh-borders.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Bangladesh borders">

* A heartbreaking [photo series of a shipbreaking yard in Bangladesh](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/05/shipbreakers/hettwer-photography) 
* I spent last winter in Bangladesh, and struggled to explain to people what the political situation was there. This [5 minute video by Human Rights Watch sums up the worst of the elections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np0VRghHJa4).

* The untold story of [the Bangladesh-Palestine alliance from the 1980s](http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/remembering-past-bangladeshi-fighters-palestine-1980s)


* Great article on the [rebirth of comic books in Bangladesh](http://indianquarterly.com/graphic-content/).
* [Savifa, the "virtual library South Asia”](http://savifa.uni-hd.de/thematicportals/periodicals/overview.html), with a huge range of digitised archive of materials from colonial Bengal.

## All-women lists

One of the biggest arguments I come across when asking why more women weren't included is "but we couldn't find any." This year I came across a number of lists of women in various professions, giving them the much-deserved kudos for work they're doing, and making it ever so simple for to be 'found' if people are looking to talk to women. No more excuses for not being able to find women in [data visualisation/technology/books by women]* (fill in as appropriate) - and on my list of things to do is to come up with some lists of my own, as I feel like I come across brilliant women all the time! 

* As part of the #readwomen2014 campaign, here's a list of ["14 timeless reads by women"](http://explore.noodle.com/post/74075385859/in-honor-of-readwomen2014-an-effort-to-equalize), by [Maria Popova.](http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/about/)
* [Top 100 movies of all time, by female directors.](http://scriptchix.com/2014/02/top-100-movies-of-all-time-by-female-directors/) by [Miranda Sajdak](http://scriptchix.com/author/adminm/)
* I've referred so many people to this post this year: [“The Women of Crisis Mapping”](http://irevolution.net/2013/03/05/women-of-crisis-mapping/), by [Patrick Meier.](https://twitter.com/PatrickMeier)
* It's fairly US-centric, but you get the picture: [An Incomplete List of Females in Data Visualization](http://stephanieevergreen.com/females-in-dataviz/) (with an accompanying, ever growing [Twitter list](https://twitter.com/evergreendata/lists/females-in-dataviz/members)).
* My own [list of women writers from Latin America](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/11/14/latin-american-women-writers/) crowdsourced via twitter. Thanks, kind people!
