## Art as activism

There's many, many more out there - here are just a few of my favourites.

![Not a bug splat]({{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/nbugsplat-screenshot.png)

* Above: [Not A Bug Splat](http://notabugsplat.com/), a giant art installation that targets predator drone operators, is a really powerful example of art as political activism, and created by an artist collective in Pakistan and the US.
* [@blprnt](https://twitter.com/blprnt) started collecting some great examples of data/ethics/privacy art projects [in this list](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/JkiBESA0z4).
* [Hack the Art World](http://hacktheartworld.com/) was a great response to Google's efforts at "DevArt".
* [People quote people](http://www.paolocirio.net/work/people-quote-people/) is an interesting play on the notion of 'authorship' and accreditation. By [Paolo Cirio](http://www.paolocirio.net/), who has a lot of other great art/activism projects.

## Coding

There are lots of collections of these, so I'm not going to start a new one here; instead, just a couple of my favourites, that I actually used this year.

* [Learning CSS selectors](https://flukeout.github.io/) with fun and food, by [@flukeout](https://twitter.com/flukeout)
* An [excellent tutorial on building a Jekyll site](http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial), by [Andrew Munsell.](http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/). I followed this all the way through to build this site!
* [Visualising Git with D3](https://onlywei.github.io/explain-git-with-d3/#): a lovely, interactive, explanatory tool, by [Wei Wang.](https://github.com/onlywei)
* Somewhat contradictory, but I like a lot about this article on why ["No, you don't need to learn to code"](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3020126/no-you-dont-need-to-learn-to-code).

## Data visualisation

I really hadn't realised how much I look out for, and really admire, good data visualisations. Generally, they fall into one of two categories: ones which highlight issues that would otherwise be all too easy to ignore; or, those making complicated information more understandable.

* Turning the tables on the Sochi Winter Olympics, [this site](http://sochi.fbk.info/en/) created some new sports and prizes for people who benefited from the most expensive Winter Olympics of all time. A playful and accessible way of highlighting corrupt practices, made by the [Anti Corruption Foundation.](http://fbk.info/)
* A project [highlighting what public transport networks actually look like for those with limited accessibility](http://mappable.info/blog/2014/2/8/accessibility); from a group that work on urban planning, data visualisation and mapping based in Hamburg, check out their blog at [Mappable.info](http://mappable.info/).
* [The Migrants Files](https://www.detective.io/detective/the-migrants-files/), bringing together data on people who have died on their way to Europe. A project on Detective.io, by [J++](http://www.jplusplus.org/en/).
* This [interactive circle plot](http://www.global-migration.info/) showing migration flows, is great, and there's also a [version specifically for migration in Germany](http://www.german-migration.info/), too. By [Nikola Sander](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/staff/staff_nikola_sander.shtml) and [Ramon Bauer](http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/staff/staff_ramon_bauer.shtml).
* Infographic on [How powerful is your passport](http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/GOOD_Passports.png) showing clearly the travel freedom that holders of different passports enjoy.
* The incredible [journey of a broken TV](http://schrottfernseher.de/), traced via GPS from Germany to Ghana. More than anything, this highlights how broken our society's relationship is with hardware.[de]
* I imagine this would only be a really interesting piece if you were already a little interested in the topic - which I am, so it's great. A scrolly, [data-driven piece from Guardian Global Development, on global remittances.](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2014/aug/19/-sp-remittances-countries-highest-fees-interactive).

<div class="pull-right"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/presenting-facts.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Graphic Methods of Presenting Facts"></div>

* Data visualisation has been around for a lot longer than I had thought: here's a book from 1914, available in full to read online, full of visualisation tips, called ["Graphic methods for presenting facts."](https://archive.org/details/graphicmethodsfo00brinrich) Hurray for the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)!
* I still can't look at this without getting a lump in my throat: [the most heart-wrenching map I've ever seen](http://www.geografiadeldolor.com/), with videos, letters, and messages from the families of the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa, Mexico. Aptly called 'Geografia del Dolor', or Geography of Pain.
* [This map](http://mundraub.org/map) shows places where publicly available food can be found in Germany- like places to pick fruit, find nuts, or wild herbs. I've yet to try it out, but I'm looking forward to doing so.
* There's no shortage of visualisations of maps, but here are some especially pretty ones: [city maps coloured by street orientation.](http://www.datapointed.net/2014/10/maps-of-street-grids-by-orientation/), by [Stephen Von Worley.](http://www.datapointed.net/) Turns out that Berlin is beautifully angled! (Below - Tempelhoferfeld)

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/berlin-angles.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Berlin Map">

* [This post](http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/mapping-berlins-transit-system/) on [Slow Travel Berlin](http://www.slowtravelberlin.com/) has lots of links and images of how Berlin's transit system has been visualised since it was created - it's a fascinating read, especially if you know the city. 
* Not strictly data visualisation, but I can imagine for people living in New York there's hours of fun to be had with [this map portal](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/), which provides over 20,000 historical maps free to download + remix.
* Again, not strictly data viz - but [this is a beautiful exercise](http://nautil.us/blog/can-you-identify-these-cities-from-their-light-signatures), getting you to identify cities by their light signature. by [Rose Eveleth](http://roseveleth.com/) for [Nautilus.](http://nautil.us/).
* A great collection of [physical interpretations of data](http://dataphys.org/list/) through history.


## Language

* Beautiful [illustrations of animal sounds in different languages](http://chapmangamo.tumblr.com/), by [James Chapman](https://twitter.com/chapmangamo)


<div class="pull-left"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/blog/2014/monkey-sounds.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Monkey Sounds"></div>

* A brilliant [long read on research into the science of learning languages](http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/secret-military-test-coming-soon-to-your-spanish-class), by [Michael Erard](https://twitter.com/michaelerard).
* A [visualisation project graphing the position of English letters in words](http://www.prooffreader.com/2014/05/graphing-distribution-of-english.html), by [David Taylor.](https://twitter.com/@prooffreader)
* An art project on the [utterly ludricous use of language analysis](http://lawrenceabuhamdan.com/#/conflictedphonemes/) to determine veracity of asylum applications.
* A [visualisation project chronicling how terminology and language](http://chronicle.unhcrinnovation.org/) from the UNHCR has changed over the last 64 years.
* A [guide on internationalisation of personal names](http://t.co/By8U5nwJM3) ;if you work with people from different cultures, this is especially interesting.
* [Chronicle](http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/): a tool visualising language use in New York Times news coverage throughout its history.
* [Tube tongues](http://vis.oobrien.com/tube/#tongues), an interactive map showing languages spoken at different tube stops in London, by [Oliver O'Brien.](https://twitter.com/oobr)


## Design

I'm no designer - so, wherever I can, I try to keep an eye out for things that will make my life easier.

* I discovered the brilliant [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) this year, and haven't stopped using it since. A completely free set of icons, provided through one font.
* Ditto for the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/) for more specific icons - they have a great range, and lots available in the public domain.
* [Beautiful Web Type](http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/?1) - a curated selection of the best Google web fonts, by [Chad Mazzola](https://twitter.com/ubuwaits).

## Videos

This year, I tried for the first time to experiment with new formats of conveying messages or explaining concepts, for example with Lego stop motion vidoes, or Vines, and I discovered that (unsurprisingly) it all took a lot longer than I had thought. Here are some examples of videos made by people who have mastered the art of explaining complicated concepts in clever ways!

* [A fun animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_aOHpn_vqQ&feature=youtu.be) explaining the history of copyright.
* An [paper-letter animation on the History of Typography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOgIkxAfJsk), by [Ben Barrett-Forrest](https://twitter.com/benbf) (So clever!)
* [Another animation](http://vimeo.com/102604678) - this time, from people I know well - explaining Freedom of Information and the German Freedom of Information platform, [Frag den Staat](https://fragdenstaat.de/) [de].Video by [Sam Muirhead](http://www.cameralibre.cc/), whose work - which is all done with open source tools, and openly licensed material- I can only recommend.
* [The saddest use of Lego you ever have seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbliUq0_r4&feature=youtu.be) - Greenpeace turning the tables on the 'Everything is Awesome' lego movie slogan, as as a protest against their collaboration with Shell.


## Journalism

Mainly lists of resources, and a couple of articles. I also love that lots of people who are giving data journalism courses at universities are making their course syllabus/materials available online.

* A really [comprehensive reading list on Data Driven Journalism](http://www.smalldatajournalism.com/readings/), compiled by [Dan Nguyen](http://danwin.com/).
* Also by Dan, this site for his course on [Public Affairs Data Journalism](http://www.padjo.org/), with the stated aim of "learning how to argue with and against data" has so much stuff I want to read!
* A treasure trove of [journalism tools can be found on this Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/journalismtools/) @journalism2ls pinterest page , by [Ezra Eeman.](https://twitter.com/ezraeeman)
* A great [beginners' guide for journalists on understanding and using APIs](http://www.poynter.org/news/media-innovation/138211/beginners-guide-for-journalists-who-want-to-understand-api-documentation/), by Chrys Wu
* A really great post on [getting a job in the world of news nerds/journo coders](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/getting-job-journalism-code/) by [Jeremy B. Merrill](http://jeremybmerrill.com/) and [Sisi Wei](https://twitter.com/sisiwei).
* A very, very comprehensive [bibliography on media impact](http://brianabelson.com/open-news/2013/04/02/Impact-Bibliography.html), by [Brian Abelson](http://brianabelson.com/). I'm interested in seeing how many of the conclusions drawn from the study of media impact could be applied to the impact of global development projects... but first, I have to read some more.

## Technology articles

* ["No, Nate, brogrammers may not be macho, but that’s not all there is to it"](https://medium.com/message/no-nate-brogrammers-may-not-be-macho-but-thats-not-all-there-is-to-it-2f1fe84c5c9b) - I love this piece by [Zeynep Tufekci](https://twitter.com/zeynep) on gender and tech, and not just because she quotes Dr Seuss.
* A great post, which I've referred to multiple times this year, [on the metaphors used in email encryption](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/randomwalker/why-king-george-iii-can-encrypt/) + how this affects people's use of it, by [Arvind Narayanan.](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/author/randomwalker/) I'm a big fan generally of the [Freedom to Tinker](https://freedom-to-tinker.com) blog, too.
* [On the problems of data on sexual violence in conflict](https://visualisingadvocacy.org/blog/data-part-truth-part-lie), by [Maya Ganesh](https://twitter.com/mayameme)

* The [Living with Data](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/15/living-with-data.html) series on Al Jazeera America, a "field guide to the data and algorithms that shape our world", by [Sara M. Watson.](http://america.aljazeera.com/profiles/w/sara-m-watson.html)
* The reading list from the [Ethics of Data in Civil Society](http://pacscenter.stanford.edu/content/additional-reading) conference, held earlier this year at Stanford, is pretty full of thoughtful pieces.

## Women in Tech

To my discomfort, most of these articles are from US-based writers. I'd love to read more from people based in other parts of the world, writing on the topic of women in technology - please send me recommendations of people or blogs to follow!

* On [why lots (though not all) of well-intentioned women in tech](http://pensieve.verou.me/post/54853162595/on-women-in-tech) initiatives are actually doing more harm than good, by [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/).
* An [open letter on feminism in tech](http://aboutfeminism.me/), by a group of US-based feminists.
* A really powerful article on nerd culture and misogyny- ["Your Princess is in another castle"](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/27/your-princess-is-in-another-castle-misogyny-entitlement-and-nerds.html), by [Arthur Chu](https://twitter.com/arthur_affect).
