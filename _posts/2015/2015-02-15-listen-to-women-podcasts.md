A few weeks ago, I asked online via Twitter, and offline to friends of mine - what's your favourite podcast? 

I got these responses:

* [ChaosRadio](http://chaosradio.ccc.de/podcasts.html)
* [RadioLab](http://www.radiolab.org/)
* [NPR's Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/)
* [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
* [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) (of course!)
* [Benjamin Walker's Theory of Everything](http://toe.prx.org/)
* [The World in 100 Objects](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/ahow/all)
* [The Digital Human](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/dh)
* [The Bugle](http://thebuglepodcast.com/)
* [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)
* [n00bcore](http://n00bcore.de/)
* [Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/) *(this one is a new show!)*
* [Philosophy Bites](http://www.philosophybites.com/) 

I also looked at some 'charts' and recommendations - like this ["7 Podcasts that aren't Serial"](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/21/7430313/podcast-recommendations-reviews), and the [top iTunes podcasts in the UK](http://www.itunescharts.net/uk/charts/podcasts/2015/02/14).

I started listening to a few of the recommended shows, but before I could get on to really enjoying the content of the podcasts themselves, something else hit me.

### What do you notice about this list? 

Out of the 13 I've listed above (which were sourced as randomly as asking my Twitter followers and friends can be) - **9 are hosted or co-hosted by men**. Only four - n00bcore hosted by the lovely [Fiona](https://arduina.github.io/arduina.net/), Invisibilia, Serial and The Digital Human, are hosted by women. 

Hmm. But maybe the skewed gender balance is just down to me and my contacts: what about the ones being recommended on bigger platforms?

Here's a list from Slate of the [25 best podcasts ever](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/ten_years_in_your_ears/2014/12/best_podcast_episodes_ever_the_25_best_from_serial_to_the_ricky_gervais.html) (!)written in December 2014. Out of the 25 there, **18 are hosted exclusively by a man or men**, 3 are co-hosted by a woman and a man, and just 1 exclusively by a woman/women. (I excluded 3 from that list, as they didn't seem to have clear regular hosts).

Let's do another one, just to test. How about ['10 lesser-known podcasts'](http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2014/jan/18/10-best-lesser-known-podcasts-miranda-sawyer) as recommended by the Guardian? 

7 of the 10 are produced by men/a man, 1 is co-hosted between a man and a woman, and just 1 - [The Broad Experience](http://www.thebroadexperience.com/), which is actually explicitly **about** "women, the workplace and success‚Äù is hosted by a woman. (Again, I left 1 out of this count for lack of a clear 'host').

I'm not going to go on counting lists, but now, my question has become: **where are all the women in podcasting?**

Last year I set myself a target of [only reading books by women](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/12/26/50-books-2014/) - and it was a great experience, for many reasons. So this year, I've decided, will be **the year of listening to women.** They must be out there - and I'm determined to find them. (And maybe even start contributing to the field myself...watch this space!)

Given that I've got lots of great podcast recommendations, but actually only **5** by women - recommendations would be really welcome - I'll be using #listentowomen2015 to post the ones I find on Twitter, so please do join me! And a big thanks to everyone who populated this original list, too, I really appreciate it!
