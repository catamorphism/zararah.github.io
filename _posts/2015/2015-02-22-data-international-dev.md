Yesterday, I gave a talk at the [Stiftung Neue Verantwortung](http://www.stiftung-nv.de/) here in Berlin, about the work I've been doing looking into how data is being used in international development. I adapted a presentation I did together with [Becky Kazansky](https://www.beckykazansky.com/) at last year's re:publica, [which you can see online here](http://re-publica.de/session/data-international-development-how-even-best-intentions-can-pave-road-surveillance), where we talked about the unintended consequences of increased uses of technology in development.

For yesterday's talk, I focused more on case studies of how technology is currently being used in ICT4D, and introduced the group to some situations that are simultaneously welcomed in the ICT4D sphere while being met with horror by privacy advocates. I also talked a little about the new [UN Data Revolution report](http://www.undatarevolution.org/report/) which came out at the end of last year, and recommendations that they are giving for the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. 

In terms of ways forward, I'm glad to see that global development organisations and donors are establishing their own [Codes of Conduct](http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/a_new_donor_code_of_conduct) (though these aren't necessarily data-focused), or responsible data policies - I especially like the way that [Oxfam has been developing their own organisational policy](https://responsibledata.io/developing-an-organisational-policy-for-responsible-data/), and I would love to see other organisations adapt this or even come up with their own, hopefully in an equally open and consultative manner.
