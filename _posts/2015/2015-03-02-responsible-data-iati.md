Last week, I joined the [Responsible Data for Humanitarian Response](http://www.responsible-data.org/) meeting in The Hague, where I had the pleasure of moderating a session on civic data streams, as well as talking about the [International Aid Transparency Initiative](http://www.aidtransparency.net/) process, together with [Roderick Besseling](https://twitter.com/rbesseling) of Cordaid. Roderick talked more about the specifics of using IATI within Cordaid, and it was really impressive to see how they are actually using internally the data they publish to IATI - while I talked about IATI data from a more general perspective. 

I'm planning to write up the notes from the discussion very soon, but in the meantime, here are the slides I used for the discussion.
