In the days since the tragic earthquake in Nepal, various forms of assistance have been offered from governments, charities, humanitarian response organisations, and by for-profit technology companies, whose reach and influence is bigger than ever before.

In many ways, it's quite incredible that we have an expectation that international corporations and companies should offer some kind of response or assistance in the wake of a humanitarian emergency; but in fact, they're very well placed to do so in lots of cases.

Here's a list of responses from tech companies that I've come across so far; I'm sure I've missed some out, and I'll keep updating it, so please let me know which ones I've missed out! 

* Google activated their [Person Finder](https://google.org/personfinder/2015-nepal-earthquake/) tool for Nepal, allowing individuals to post and search for the status of relatives or friends. 

* [Viber](https://www.viber.com/en/) have switched off charges for 'Viber Out' calls from Nepal, meaning that users in Nepal can call anywhere for free (for now).

* Facebook launched their [Safety Check](https://www.facebook.com/safetycheck/nepalearthquake) tool, allowing others to mark their friends profiles as 'safe', and letting individual users notify their friends that they're in the affected area. 

* Airbnb activated their [Disaster Response tool](http://blog.airbnb.com/emergency-response-to-earthquake-in-nepal/?) in the area, allowing "individuals to list their space for free to support those who may have been impacted by the initial and subsequent earthquakes." - though, given the scale of the disaster, it's worth noting that this response is probably not that effective, and actually [only one property seems to be listed.](https://www.airbnb.com/disaster/nepal-earthquake). In the past though, for example in during cases of extreme floods, this response from Airbnb has been much more effective.

* [Digital Globe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/): a North American commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content, and operator of civilian remote sensing spacecraft, has [opened up access to satellite imagery of Nepal](http://www.digitalglobeblog.com/2015/04/26/digitalglobe-opens-access-to-satellite-data-to-support-disaster-response-efforts-in-nepal/) to help support disaster response efforts.
