The first full episode of my new podcast, Collusion, is now up, and you can listen directly below:

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/204167965&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe>

Doing the research for this was incredibly interesting, and so just in case other people want to know what sources we drew upon, we've started a Tumblr, [https://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com](http://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com/), where we'll be putting research and links that we find in preparation for the podcast.

You can subscribe [here for iTunes users](https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/collusion-podcast-rss-feed/id992610040?l=en), and [here's the RSS feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:145673510/sounds.rss) if you don't use iTunes.
