The second episode of Collusion is now up, focusing on the theme of **water**. In it, I talk about how the British used water technologies as a key part of colonial policy in former British India, and [Luiza](https://twitter.com/luizaprado), my co-presenter, talks about current day examples from Palestine and Brazil. This time though, we produced two versions: the regular one, and a "closed access version", which I explain more about below.

While I was looking into how water was treated under British colonial policy, I came across a lot of articles on the subject of "colonialism and irrigation technology", and "water inequality" that were, frustratingly, behind a paywall. I don't have access to academic journals, so the only way I could access these articles - all of which seemed to have been paid for with public money - was by emailing friends and asking them to download them for me, and send me them.

So, while I was doing the research, I made a point of marking what information I was finding for the podcast that was "closed access" - ie. only available for those who pay for access, or for those who belong to institutions that pay. As with the first episode, we [published on the Tumblr](http://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com/post/123357370759/episode-2-water-research-and-links) a list of sources we found while researching this episode, and as you can see, many of them were closed access. 

As many have said before me, [scholarly publishing is broken](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/07/11/scholarly-publishing-broken-guerrilla-self-publishing/), and to illustrate this in more depth, at least for the UK, Michelle Brook, Stuart Lawson and Ben Meghreblian have also published [a more detailed database outlining the cost that individual UK universities pay to different academic publishers](http://figshare.com/articles/Journal_subscription_costs_FOIs_to_UK_universities/1186832), the figures for which they got access to through Freedom of Information requests. As an example of how huge this is, the university that I went to, Durham University, spent over **£1.44 million in 2014** in fees to academic journals - and they spent almost the exact same amount (£1.49 million) paying the salaries of **all academic staff at the university**.

While I was complaining about this broken system, my friend [Julia](https://twitter.com/j_kloiber) suggested making a second version of Collusion - one where we bleeped out access to the information we got from closed access papers. 

Here it is:

I'm not really expecting anyone to listen to the whole of the 'closed access' version - but I like it as a way of showing orally how frustrating the research process was - and I hope people enjoy the proper version of the podcast. Comments and feedback on both versions are always welcome - we're both new to podcasting!
