The third full episode of Collusion is online! This episode, we looked at **food**: the role that food played in colonialism in the past, things that happen now that echo the power structures that we see in colonialism, like food speculation, and new technologies aimed at addressing world hunger.

I also came across a transcript that the crew at [OpenTranscripts](http://opentranscripts.org/) kindly did of the episode: [it's online here](http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/collusion-3-food/) - along with [our other episodes](http://opentranscripts.org/sources/collusion/) too, in full.

Links to [research for the latest episode are up on the Tumblr](http://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com/post/126832910754/episode-3-food-research-and-links) - during the research for this episode, our main source of information seems to have been media articles and NGO reports rather than academic papers, so thankfully we didn't have too many problems of important papers being behind a paywall.

As always, comments and criticism on the episode are welcome - we hope you like it!
