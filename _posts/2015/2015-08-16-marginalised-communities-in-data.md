To learn more about this theme, I'd recommend the following pieces (and I'll be adding to this list, too):

* [“Ethnic” statistics and data protection in the Council of Europe countries](https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/activities/Themes/Ethnic_statistics_and_data_protection.pdf) by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance
* [Land exchange deal: Will you go to Bangladesh? Not many Yes in enclaves](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/will-you-go-to-bangladesh-not-many-yes-in-enclaves-2/99/#sthash.j7AE5BpW.dpuf)
