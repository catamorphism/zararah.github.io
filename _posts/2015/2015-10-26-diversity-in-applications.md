*Caveat: right now, these are my thoughts but they will (hopefully!) iterate with time and smart arguments to help me evolve my thinking.*

Humour me with a little thought experiment. You're doing a review of some job applications. Innovation is very important to the position and your company in general, so you add "innovativeness" as one of the criteria; that is, the likelihood that someone is to be innovative.

You go through the applications, and you add scorings to that category for each applicant. The category is weighted equally to the others, say, "Relevant experience", "Demonstrable topic interest" and "Technical expertise." You add up the average of these scores, then you divide them by the number of categories to get a shortlist of the top-ranked candidates as according to the most important categories for you. Then, you interview the top 5. You've come up with some great candidates, because you included all of the criteria that matter most.

Imagine this scenario again, but this time, though what you're looking for in a candidate hasn't changed at all, remove the category of "innovativeness". Why? Because it's a blind review, and because "innovativeness" can be a synonym for "diversity".

<!--more-->

It's been proven over and over again that people from diverse backgrounds are more likely to be innovative; bringing a range of perspectives to the table, challenging others assumptions on the team, approaching problems in different ways. So why would we ignore those benefits when we're evaluating applications?

In advance of the cry of protest that I can anticipate:

*But they didn't do anything to earn that diversity* - I don't know about you, but I didn't do anything to "earn" my British passport which has allowed me to do any number of things that appear on my CV (like go to a good university with minimal fees, or to travel to a bunch of wonderful places). Nor did I "earn" my supportive family, or being born in Europe, or... you see where I'm going with this? So many things that are included in applications aren't earned but are through serendipity, chance and privilege; why would this criteria be any different?

*But then you might miss out more technically skilled candidates..* - yes, and? Technical expertise can be learned by smart people. Experiencing a different perspective on the world because of your social standing, your skin colour, or your sexual orientation (to name just a few ways of understanding diverse perspectives) can't; and it's these points that make a certain candidate more interesting to have around.

*But that's discriminatory against people of non-diverse backgrounds*. OK, sure. If you happen to be a cis white heterosexual male from a Western background, yes, this might seem like it discriminates against you. But - and this might be hard to stomach - all the choices, decisions, achievements that you've accomplished so far have, in some part, been made easier by the way that you look. (Yes, I know, you worked hard, but [we do not live in a meritocracy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/girls-boys-leadership-or-_b_3187707.html)). So why, just this one time, can't the same bonuses be given to others?

*But we've already reached adequate representation of diversity in our companies*. This isn't about matching a quota; it's about recognising that people of diverse backgrounds **bring benefits to your company** that others can't. Similar to realising that somoene who has great people skills is good for a particularly social position, in this case, it's that problem-solving might be more successful by those with different ideas. 

In short; diversity isn't something that we should be **ignoring**, it's something that we should be **recognising and rewarding**. So, enough with blind reviews. You companies claiming to be "innovative" or "ground-breaking" while having a bunch of people with the exact same perspective on life? You're doing it wrong.

PS. Below are a few quotes and reports that back up some of the points I've made above, and I'm sure that there are more.
