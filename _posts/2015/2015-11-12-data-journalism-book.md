Last week, a new book [Data Journalism: Inside the global future](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Journalism-Inside-global-future/dp/1845496639) was launched, to which I contributed a chapter.

The chapter I wrote was called 'So you found a unicorn- what now?' which takes a look at the cultural changes needed to successfully integrate technologists into a newsroom. Taking lessons from the fabulous [Knight-Mozilla OpenNews fellowships](https://opennews.org), the brilliant work done by [Code4South Africa](http://code4sa.org/), as well as my own experience working alongside journalists and technologists and anecdotes I've heard along the way, I argue that doing data journalism properly needs more than having tech skills - it's a culture change, and a new way of collaborating within newsrooms.
