At the end of 2013, I came across a lot of 'feminist round ups' of the year that covered only achievements happening in the US and Europe. [This frustrated me](http://zararah.net/blog/2014/04/13/getting-new-perspectives-online-listening-to-the/). So, in 2014, I started collecting tweets that I came across which linked to cool examples of fierce feminists from the [majority world](https://masalai.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/majority-world-a-new-word-for-a-new-age/) - and at the end of the year, I wrote this post - [24 fierce acts of feminism you probably didn't hear about in 2014.](http://www.buzzfeed.com/zararah/24-fierce-acts-of-feminism-you-probably-didnt-hea-16n5q) 

Last year, I was slightly less attentive to curating my [Majority World feminism timeline](https://twitter.com/zararah/timelines/420423544334336000), but I still managed to get some good ones. So, a little late, but here are my favourite examples of majority world feminism, from 2015.
