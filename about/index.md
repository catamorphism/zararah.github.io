#About Me 

I'm Zara- a feminist, bookworm, language geek and traveller. I grew up and studied in the UK, spent a few months living in Brive-la-Gaillarde in France and Madrid, Spain, and I've been living in Berlin, Germany since July 2012. I've been lucky enough to have spent considerable amounts of time in other parts of the world too; Bangladesh, where my family is from; Switzerland; a summer in Venezuela and another in India, and I had a lot of fun visiting Libya regularly during the civil war in 2011 and afterwards in 2012, among other odd bits of travel - now, mainly thanks to my job. I especially like Beirut and Buenos Aires, and Bristol too.
 

Until January 2014, I worked as the International Community Manager at the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org), and before that I worked as a Research Associate, and the first employee, at [OpenOil](http://openoil.net), working on transparency in the extractive industries, looking especially at contract transparency in the MENA region.
 

Since January 2014, I've been leading work on the [Open Development Toolkit](http://opendevtoolkit.net), with [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org) from the Open Knowledge Foundation and [Development Initiatives](http://devinit.org), where I work somewhere between international development and data.
