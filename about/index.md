I'm Zara - feminist, researcher and information activist, living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the field of information accessibility and data use among civil society for over five years, from a number of different angles. I hold British and Bangladeshi nationalities, grew up in the UK, and I speak fluent French, German, Spanish and bits of Arabic and Bengali.

I've worked in over 25 countries around the world, running workshops on topics from data storytelling to contract transparency, carrying out field research, and learning and collaborating with world-changing activists and technology and advocacy organisations. Most of my time is now taken up working on research at [the engine room](http://theengineroom.org/), a non-profit organisation investigating and supporting the effective use of data and technology in advocacy, and with a number of side projects such as writing, and my podcast, [Collusion](https://soundcloud.com/collusion), examining the intersection of technology and power.


## Professional experience

I began my journey into information activism in 2009 with [Access Info Europe](http://www.access-info.org/), in Madrid, Spain, and then moved on to become the first employee at [OpenOil](http://openoil.net), in Berlin, Germany. At OpenOil, I focused on transparency and information flows in the extractive industries, which included carrying out research in Libya during the 2011 revolution, and coordinating + contributing to the book [How to read and understand an oil contract](http://contracts.openoil.net), which has now been downloaded over 200K times.

In 2013, I moved on to work for [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org) as International Community Manager. This gave me the opportunity to work closely with Open Knowledge's local groups around the world, supporting them in their work and learning how open knowledge and open data is used in different cultures and contexts. In 2014, I changed role to focus more on the theme of Open Development, in a joint project between Open Knowledge and [Development Initiatives](http://devinit.org), where I looked at how civil society and journalists were using international development data and built the [Open Development Toolkit](http://opendevtoolkit.net). Through this project, I became part of the fabulous [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org) team, working on data storytelling, carrying out data literacy trainings and workshops, and creating a curriculum on Aid Data. After becoming more connected with the School of Data network, I took on running their second full Fellowship programme, through which we identified 7 great individuals from around the world to be supported through the 9 month scheme.

I spent the first half of 2015 freelancing, and took on work with other clients like [Tactical Technology Collective](tacticaltech.org) on write-up from the Gender and Technology Institute, which I attended in December 2014, before becoming Research Lead at [the engine room](http://theengineroom.org/). As part of that role, I work on topics varying from technology for human rights defenders, to responsible data challenges, to gender and women's rights activism.

In 2015, I started a podcast, [Collusion](https://soundcloud.com/collusion), with Luiza Prado, where we explore the relationship between technology and power in the past, and subsequent effects on our relationship with technology today, focusing on global south countries. You can listen to [why we started it](https://soundcloud.com/collusion/pilot-episode) - and, as part of our quest to make these kinds of topics more accessible, we're collating [research and links that we come across on a Tumblr](http://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com/).

I blog regularly on this site, and recently started writing more for other outlets, like [Global Voices](https://globalvoices.org/author/zararahman/) and the [Guardian Global Development network.](http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/feb/03/five-ways-tech-crowdsourcing-womens-empowerment)
