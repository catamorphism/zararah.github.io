I'm Zara - feminist, researcher, information activist, and linguist, among other things, living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the field of information accessibility and data use among civil society for over five years, from a number of different angles. I hold British and Bangladeshi nationalities, grew up in the UK, and I speak fluent French, German, Spanish and bits of Arabic and Bengali.

After working full-time for the past few years, I'm currently freelancing and looking to try some new things. I recently started a podcast, [Collusion](https://soundcloud.com/collusion), with Luiza Prado, where we explore the relationship between technology and power in the past, and subsequent effects on our relationship with technology today, focusing on global south countries. You can listen to [why we started it](https://soundcloud.com/collusion/pilot-episode) - and, as part of our quest to make these kinds of topics more accessible, we're collating [research and links that we come across on a Tumblr](http://collusionpodcast.tumblr.com/).

I'd love [to hear from you](mailto:mail@zararah.net) if you're looking for someone to work on any of the things I talk about below. At the moment, my interests lie broadly within: technology and data for social good, civic technology, information accessibility and activism, open development, ICT4D, open data, data journalism, feminism, gender and diversity in technology. Outside of the above, I love reading and writing, meeting new people, connecting kindred spirits, and travelling, too.

Anyway - if you'd like to know more about me, or my work, or if you'd just like to chat, drop me a line on mail[at]zararah.net.


## Previous experience 

I started off at [Access Info Europe](http://www.access-info.org/), in Madrid, Spain, and then moved on to become the first employee at [OpenOil](http://openoil.net), in Berlin, Germany. At OpenOil, I focused on transparency in the extractive industries, which included carrying out research in Libya during the 2011 revolution, and coordinating + contributing to the book [How to read and understand an oil contract](http://contracts.openoil.net).

During 2013-2014, I worked at the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org), first as the International Community Manager, and then leading work on the theme of 'open development', balancing somewhere between the intersection of international development and use of technology and data (ICT4D), during which time I created the [Open Development Toolkit.](http://opendevtoolkit.net)

Now, I consult to [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org), leading their [Fellowship programme](http://schoolofdata.org/fellowship-programme/) on a part time basis. I'm also a Fellow at the Centre for Internet & Human Rights at European University Viadrina. In September 2014, I co-authored a book on the responsible use of data in international development, which you can [download here.](https://responsibledata.io/ways-to-practise-responsible-development-data/) 

## Fun stuff 

In my spare time, I've recently started contributing to [Hystereo](https://soundcloud.com/berlincommunityradio/hystereo-4-feminist-science-fiction), a radio show talking about feminism + all kinds of topics, which airs every couple of weeks on Berlin Community Radio. I also take (irregular) djembe lessons, dabble in learning to code (like building this website!), and love reading a lot, especially feminist science fiction. 

You can find me offline in cafes around Berlin, and online, on twitter [@zararah](http://twitter.com/zararah), or via mail@zararah.net. [(Public Key)](http://zararah.net/about/key.html)
