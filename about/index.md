I'm Zara - feminist, bookworm, language geek and traveller, among other things, living in Berlin, Germany. I've been working in the field of information accessibility and (open) data use in civil society groups for over five years, from a number of different angles.

I started off at [Access Info Europe](http://www.access-info.org/), in Madrid, Spain, and then moved on to become the first employee at [OpenOil](http://openoil.net), in Berlin, Germany. At OpenOil, I focused on transparency in the extractive industries, which included carrying out research in Libya during the 2011 revolution, and coordinating + contributing to the book [How to read and understand an oil contract](http://contracts.openoil.net).

Since early 2013, I've been working at the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org), first as the International Community Manager, and since the beginning of 2014, leading work on the theme of 'open development', balancing somewhere between the intersection of international development and use of technology and data (ICT4D). I work closely with [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org), too, which gives me the opportunity to work with information activists from around the world.

I'm a Fellow at the Centre for Internet & Human Rights at European University Viadrina, and I enjoy researching and writing about the themes of accountability, data use in international development, and discrimination. In September 2014, I co-authored a book on the responsible use of data in international development, which you can [download here.](https://responsibledata.io/ways-to-practise-responsible-development-data/) 

In my spare time, I've recently started contributing to [Hystereo](https://soundcloud.com/berlincommunityradio/hystereo-4-feminist-science-fiction), a radio show talking about feminism + all kinds of topics, which airs every couple of weeks on Berlin Community Radio. I also take (irregular) djembe lessons, dabble in learning to code (like building this website!), and am attempting to read 50 books in 2014, written only by women.

You can find me offline in cafes around Berlin, and online, on twitter [@zararah](http://twitter.com/zararah), or via zararah[at]gmail.com.
